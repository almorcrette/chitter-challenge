# Chitter Challenge

In this project I demonstrate the skills that I've learned in week 4 of the Makers Academy Bootcamp, by building a small Twitter clone that allows the users to post messages to a public stream.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
* Test drive a simple web app with a database

## Feature specifications

## Running tests

`test_command` (e.g. `rspec`)

## File manifest



----------------------------------------------

At the barest minimum, it should contain a description of what the code does, how to install it, how to use it and how to run its tests. In addition, READMEs often include other information such as:

- Configuration instructions
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
- A news section (usually for users)
